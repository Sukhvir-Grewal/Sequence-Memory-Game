[Link To game](https://wonderful-chebakia-6720da.netlify.app/)<br>

This Project is Replica of [humanbenchmark's](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/sequence) game sequence memory game. Where we have 9 boxes that will glow at random phase and player have to click on exact same sequence every time the sequence entered by player is correct/same he/she will continue to next level where the number of glows will increase as well as the speed

>[!NOTE]
> I tried to make this website game exactly same, but i couldn't copy the Different sounds that will play on click, what i did instead to use Piano's keys to replace those sounds which not gonna lie sounds good sometimes
